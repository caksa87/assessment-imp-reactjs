# Super Simple Post CRUD Application Built with React.js and Chakra UI

As mentioned in title, this project is an simple post CRUD application. See post list, add new post, update existing post, and delete post is most used features in this application.

Normally I separate parts of code into reusable component, but since it's a simple application I don't, so I drop everything in the `./src/App.js`
